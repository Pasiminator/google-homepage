This current project is to create a google homepage. Its basiclly self-taught me how to script and link css and hmtl files to make a google landing page.
The experience was mind-boggling. i almost gave up numerous times having no experience in scripting both languages but i managed to pull through. 
Moral Lesson: its good to be patient and persistence works everytime!
